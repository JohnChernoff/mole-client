    <h1> How to play MoleChess </h1>
    <h3>
            MoleChess is a team chess game with three or more players per side. One of the players on each side is a
            "Mole", who is trying to lose the game. <br> <br>

            Moves are chosen randomly from all moves made by the individual team members each turn. The team may vote
            out a suspected Mole at any time, but only once - if the team fails to identify the Mole, the mole will then
            be able to play disastrous moves for the rest of the game without fear of reprisal. <br> <br>

            If the Mole is correctly identified, the other players receive a bonus and the Mole "defects" over to the
            other side where they become a regular team member. <br> <br>

            To start a game, first click "New", select a game title, and then click "Start".  If the game has fewer than
            three human players per side, the rest of the spots will be filled with robots who can play chess but not
            (yet) vote.  If the robot is a mole, it will play at a weaker strength than its brethren. <br> <br>

            To vote another player as the Mole, click the "Accuse" box next to the suspected Player. Your vote will
            remain until changed or everyone else (minus the suspected Mole) votes for the same player. <br> <br>

            This game is very new and subject to rapid change.
