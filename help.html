    <h1> How to play MoleChess </h1>
    <h3>
        <p> MoleChess is a team chess game with three or more players per side. One of the players on each side is a
            "Mole", who is trying to lose the game.
        </p>
        <p> Moves are chosen randomly from all moves made by the individual team members each turn. The team may vote
            out a suspected Mole at any time, but only once - if the team fails to identify the Mole, the mole will then
            be able to play disastrous moves for the rest of the game without fear of reprisal.
        </p>
        <p> If the Mole is correctly identified, the other players receive a bonus and the Mole "defects" over to the
            other side where they become a regular team member.
        </p>
